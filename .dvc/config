# as agreed with TAs, we are using DVC remote to point to raw data CSV file in the original Github repo
# we tried to use DVC with gdrive, but all of us failed to marry them together, it "works on my machine", but not in github actions
# the reason is known authentication issue
# so we decided to proceed with this workaround to unblock ourselves and move forward with the project, because authentication wiith gdrive is out of scope of the course
