# ITU BDS MLOPS'25 - Project


# FROM HERE WE WILL HAVE OUR OWN PROJECT DESCRIPTION!

# Exam Project for Data Science in Production: MLOps and Software Engineering for team Git Gut 

Note: We wanted to implement DVC with GoogleDrive connection, but dues to an authentication issue we werew not able to use this approach - it only worked for the repo owner. We decided to fall back to DVC hanling from GitHub. 

## Team members:
